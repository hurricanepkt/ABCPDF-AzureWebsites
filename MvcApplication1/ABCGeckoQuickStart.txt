Important:


The ABCGecko engine consists of two parts:

1) The "ABCGeckoWP.exe" worker process

2) The "XULRunnerXX_X" folder



Visual Studio will automatically copy the worker process executable and XULRunner folder to your output directory.

Alternatively you can use an ABCpdf11 config section in your config file to instruct ABCpdf where to find the XULRunner folder.

There are details in the ABCpdf documentation under SetConfigSection and XULRunnerDirectory.



To use the ABCGecko HTML engine, set the Doc.HtmlOptions.Engine to EngineType.Gecko in your ABCpdf code.
